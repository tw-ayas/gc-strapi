GraphCommerce is a framework for building headless ecommerce storefronts in
React and Next.js. It provides a best-in-class example, including components and
utilities, to deliver a high-performance, high-quality ecommerce Progressive Web
App (PWA).

This repo has changes included to integrate Strapi as the headless CMS instead of Hygraph. Strapi can be self-hosted for free and offers a GraphQl Api as well.
